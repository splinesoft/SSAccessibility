/**
 * SSSpeechSynthesizer manages a queue of lines of text, speaking one at a time
 * with VoiceOver, then speaking the next line when speaking finishes.
 *
 * The user can interrupt speech by tapping any element on screen that is announced by VoiceOver.
 *
 * Why not use iOS 7's AVSpeechSynthesizer?
 * You should if you can. AVSpeechSynthesizer is good for speaking long blobs of text.
 * But there are reasons to prefer VoiceOver:
 * `AVSpeechSynthesizer` requires iOS 7
 * `AVSpeechSynthesizer` doesn't always pause or stop speaking when asked
 * The user can set her preferred VoiceOver speaking rate in Settings.app, but there is no programmatic API access to that default speech rate -- say, for use in your `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
 * `AVSpeechSynthesizer` doesn't stop speaking (only ducks) when VoiceOver starts, so two voices will be speaking at once
 * The user can immediately interrupt VoiceOver by tapping any element on screen
