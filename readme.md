iOS Accessibility and VoiceOver helpers, including a VoiceOver speech synthesizer.

`SSAccessibility` powers a speech synthesizer in my app [MUDRammer - A Modern MUD Client for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mudrammer-a-modern-mud-client/id597157072?mt=8).

## Install

Install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'SSAccessibility', :head # YOLO
```

## SSSpeechSynthesizer

`SSSpeechSynthesizer` manages a queue of lines of text, speaking one at a time with VoiceOver, then speaking the next line when speaking finishes.

The user can interrupt speech by tapping any element on screen that is announced by VoiceOver.

Check out the `Example` project to see it in action.

### Why not use iOS 7's `AVSpeechSynthesizer`?

You should if you can. `AVSpeechSynthesizer` is good for speaking long blobs of text. But there are reasons to prefer VoiceOver:

* `AVSpeechSynthesizer` requires iOS 7
* `AVSpeechSynthesizer` doesn't always pause or stop speaking when asked
* The user can set her preferred VoiceOver speaking rate in Settings.app, but there is no programmatic API access to that default speech rate for speaking with `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
* `AVSpeechSynthesizer` doesn't stop speaking (only ducks volume) when VoiceOver starts, so two voices will be speaking at once
* The user can immediately interrupt VoiceOver by tapping any accessible element on screen

## SSAccessibility

Accessibility helpers. See `SSAccessibility.h`.

```objc
// Speak some text with VoiceOver. This is a shortcut for UIAccessibilityPostNotification.
[SSAccessibility speakWithVoiceOver:@"Hello world!"];
```
